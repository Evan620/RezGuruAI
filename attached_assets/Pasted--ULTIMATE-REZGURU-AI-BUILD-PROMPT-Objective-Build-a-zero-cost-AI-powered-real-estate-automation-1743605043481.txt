🌟 ULTIMATE REZGURU AI BUILD PROMPT
Objective: Build a zero-cost, AI-powered real estate automation platform that:

Scrapes off-market leads (tax delinquents, probate, FSBOs)

Scores & routes leads using AI

Automates outreach (SMS/email/voice calls)

Generates legal docs (dispute letters, contracts)

Self-hosts everything (no monthly fees)

AI Agent Permissions:

You may add missing steps if critical (e.g., error handling, security)

You may suggest optimizations (e.g., faster libraries, cheaper APIs)

You must confirm before proceeding between phases

🏗️ PHASE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP
Step 1.1 – Frontend (Next.js Dashboard)

Pages Needed:

/dashboard: Lead pipeline (Kanban view)

Columns: New → Contacted → Closed

Each card shows: Name, Motivation Score, Last Contact
Dashboard

/automations: Drag-and-drop workflow builder (like Zapier)

Left sidebar: Triggers (New lead, Email opened)

Right sidebar: Actions (Send SMS, Generate PDF)

Middle canvas: Connect nodes with arrows

/documents: Upload PDFs → AI extracts fields → Auto-fill templates

Preview pane shows generated contract with editable fields

Step 1.2 – Backend (Appwrite + n8n)

Database Tables:

markdown
Copy
| Collection  | Fields                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| `leads`     | name, phone, source (tax/probate/FSBO), motivation_score (0-100), status |
| `workflows` | trigger (e.g., "new_lead"), actions (e.g., ["sms", "call"]), user_id |
| `documents` | lead_id, type (contract/dispute), s3_url, generated_at |
Hosting:

bash
Copy
# Deploy Appwrite (DB + Auth)
flyctl launch --image appwrite/appwrite --region lax --name rezguru-db

# Deploy n8n (Automation)
flyctl launch --image n8nio/n8n --region lax --name rezguru-auto
🔍 PHASE 2: DATA SCRAPING WORKFLOW
Step 2.1 – Tax Delinquent Scraper

Input: County website URL (e.g., maricopa.gov/tax-delinquent)

Process:

Scrape using Scrapy + Rotating Proxies

Clean data with Pandas (remove duplicates)

Output:

json
Copy
{
  "name": "John Smith",  
  "address": "123 Main St, Phoenix, AZ",  
  "source": "tax_delinquent",  
  "amount_owed": "$4,200" 
}

  B --> C[Trigger n8n Workflow]
  C --> D[AI Score Lead]
Step 2.2 – Probate Lead Scraper

Challenge: Courts use scanned PDFs → OCR Solution:

python
Copy
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('probate_record.jpg'))
probate_data = {
    "deceased": text.split("Deceased:")[1].split("\n")[0].strip(),
    "property": text.split("Property:")[1].split("\n")[0].strip()
}
🤖 PHASE 3: AI INTEGRATION
Step 3.1 – Lead Scoring (Free AI)

Prompt Template:

text
Copy
Analyze this real estate lead and rate motivation to sell (1-100):

Lead Details:
- Source: {source}
- Message: "I inherited my mom's house and need to sell fast."
- Price: {price}

Considerations:
- Higher score if keywords: "inherited", "divorce", "quick sale"  
- Lower score if: "just testing market"
Implementation:

python
Copy
from transformers import pipeline

analyzer = pipeline("text-generation", model="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta")
score = analyzer(prompt_template)[0]['generated_text']  # Returns "85" 
Step 3.2 – AI Voice Calls

Workflow:

Lead hits motivation_score > 80

n8n triggers Azure TTS call:

python
Copy
"Hi {name}, this is RezGuru. We buy inherited homes fast. Press 1 to talk now."
If "1" pressed → Forward to agent’s phone via Twilio

📄 PHASE 4: DOCUMENT GENERATION
Step 4.1 – Dispute Letter Builder

User Flow:

Upload credit report PDF → AI extracts negative items → Auto-fills FCRA dispute template

mermaid
Copy
graph TB
  A[Upload PDF] --> B[Extract Text with PyPDF2]
  B --> C[Identify Late Payments/Collections]
  C --> D[Fill LaTeX Template]
  D --> E[Download PDF]
Code:

python
Copy
from pylatex import Document, Section
doc = Document()
doc.append(Section("FCRA Dispute Letter"))
doc.append(f"Date: {datetime.now().strftime('%m/%d/%Y')}")
doc.generate_pdf("dispute_letter")
💰 PHASE 5: MONETIZATION & LAUNCH
Step 5.1 – Freemium Model

Tier	Price	Features

Blog: "How we automated 200 leads/day with AI"

🛠️ AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
Start with Phase 1 → Confirm infrastructure is live before proceeding.

Add error handling where missing (e.g., retries for failed scrapes).

Optimize freely:

Replace slow APIs (e.g., swap Azure TTS for Mimic3 if rate-limited)

Suggest UX improvements (e.g., add a "Lead Hotness" thermometer graphic)

Begin when ready. Confirm each step with ✅.
